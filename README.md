# I2C2_Ideathon


I2C2 : Ideate, Innovate, Code, Compete is an ideathon. An ideathon is a short, intensive, workshop-like experience for students to address some of the most pressing challenges of our time. Participants work individually and use design thinking and innovative learning practices to ideate and collaborate on possible solutions.

Code8 and Befikra are collaborating in organising this ideathon.

Among the six categories above,I and my team decided to work on 'Sports' theme.

Our idea is to create an application framework that will provide facility to play betting game, watch and discuss different sports on same platform simultaneously.
